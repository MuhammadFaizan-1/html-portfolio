# My First Portfolio Website 🌐

This is my very first website built as part of Angela Yu’s Web Development Bootcamp.
It’s a simple portfolio website, created using only HTML, without any CSS or JavaScript.

📖 About the Project

The goal of this project was to practice the fundamentals of HTML and get comfortable with:

Structuring a webpage

Using headings, paragraphs, and lists

Adding links and images

Creating multiple pages and linking them together

This project represents my first step into the world of web development 🚀.

🛠️ Tech Used

HTML5 (only HTML, no CSS/JS yet)

📂 Features

A homepage introducing myself

Sections like About Me, Projects, and Contact

Internal links to navigate between pages

External links to showcase useful resources


🙌 Future Improvements

In the upcoming lessons of the course, I will:

Add CSS for styling

Use JavaScript for interactivity

Improve the design with better layout and responsiveness
